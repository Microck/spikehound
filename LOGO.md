| Secondary | Pulse Cyan | `#06ffd0` | Active investigation, digital energy, distinctive in DevOps space — stands out from generic blues |
| Accent | Spike Orange | `#ff6b35` | The spike visualization, alert urgency, action-oriented — represents the anomaly being hunted |
| Neutral | Charcoal Slate | `#334155` | Professional foundation, serious, technical backdrop |

**Palette Story**: This palette tells the story of intelligent alert detection — midnight indigo represents the deep technical intelligence of the multi-agent system, pulse cyan shows the active investigation happening in real-time, and spike orange calls attention to the anomaly being hunted. Unlike generic DevOps tooling with safe blues and grays, this palette has urgency and personality while remaining professional.
