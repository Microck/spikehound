# Logo Prompts for Spikehound

**Project Context**: Multi-agent incident workflow for Azure cost anomalies. Ingests alerts, fans out to specialized investigators (cost, resource config, history), synthesizes diagnosis, and proposes remediation with human approval gate.

**Suggested Vibe**: Technical, professional, trustworthy — modern DevOps/SRE tool aesthetic

**Domain Keywords**: Spike detection, hound/tracking, multi-agent investigation, Azure cloud, cost monitoring, incident response

## Design Notes

### Recommended Colors
- **Primary**: Deep teal (#009688) — from architecture diagram, suggests Azure ecosystem
- **Accent**: Alert orange/amber — for the "spike" element, conveys urgency
- **Neutral**: Charcoal or slate for text

### Usage Considerations
- Logo should work at small sizes (Slack/Discord avatars, favicon)
- Flat one-color version essential for dark mode compatibility
- Consider animated version for the "tracking" motion concept

### What to Avoid
- Literal dog illustrations (too playful for enterprise DevOps tool)
- Overly complex multi-color gradients
- 3D effects, shadows, bevels
- Photography or realistic textures
